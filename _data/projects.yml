  desc: "Engineered a thermoelectric generator using photovoltaics, which utilized the Peltier effect to produce enough electricity to charge a cell phone on-the-go. Integrated the compact system into a cooler (which provides a cool sink) that doubled as a cell phone charger, providing even more applicability and utility to the system. The project was submitted to the Synopsys Science & Engineering Fair, where it won 2nd place in the Engineering division and received the Ricoh Sustainable Development award."
